  <section id="about" class="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am Momodou Lamin Barrow, a highly motivated and detail-oriented PhD Candidate in Computer Science at the University of Tulsa, where I specialize in cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and critical infrastructure protection. My research bridges the domains of machine learning, network forensics, and cyber-physical system security, with a focus on creating explainable and resilient frameworks for anomaly detection in industrial control systems (ICS) and electric power grids. I am currently contributing to a Department of Energy (DOE)-funded research initiative led by Dr. Mauricio Papa, which aims to develop machine learning–based detection systems that safeguard U.S. power substations from cyber intrusions and physical anomalies.</p>
    <p>Before pursuing my doctoral studies, I earned an MBA in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Management from Dr. D.Y. Patil Vidyapeeth, Pune, India, a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (Magna Cum Laude) from the University of The Gambia, and a Certificate in Cisco Certified Network Associate from the Management Development Institute, The Gambia. I also completed training in Air Traffic Management and Team Resource Management at the Ghana Civil Aviation Training Academy. My career foundation is rooted in Air Traffic Control operations, where I served for nearly a decade at the Gambia Civil Aviation Authority. This experience cultivated my ability to operate under high-pressure, safety-critical environments qualities that now influence my systematic and precision-oriented approach to research and data analysis.</p>
    <p>My academic and professional journey reflects a deep commitment to innovation, resilience, and real-world impact. I have received multiple scholarships and fellowships, including those from the Department of Energy (DOE), the Government of India, and the Gambia Civil Aviation Authority, in recognition of my academic excellence and leadership potential. These honors reinforce my dedication to advancing research that strengthens the security, efficiency, and reliability of critical national infrastructures.</p>
    <p>As a researcher and educator, I am actively engaged in mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, providing guidance in areas such as data science, AI-driven network defense, and system security engineering. I take pride in promoting collaborative and interdisciplinary learning environments that encourage critical thinking, creativity, and technical mastery. My teaching philosophy is centered on building a bridge between academic theory and applied engineering practice.</p>
    <p>My long-term vision is to become a leading expert and policy influencer in the field of AI-driven cybersecurity for critical infrastructures. I aim to develop scalable, interpretable, and adaptive security architectures that not only detect and mitigate threats but also promote trust and transparency in AI decision-making processes. Through my work, I aspire to contribute to the protection of essential assets from energy distribution systems to aviation networks ensuring safer and smarter societies powered by resilient technologies.</p>

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>My research explores the convergence of artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and control systems engineering. Specifically, I investigate how machine learning algorithms can be applied to detect and predict cyber-physical anomalies in industrial control environments. I focus on designing frameworks that combine network traffic analysis and sensor-level physical data to enhance system observability, improve detection accuracy, and ensure robustness against false positives.</p>
    <p>I also study explainable AI techniques that help security operators understand the reasoning behind anomaly alerts, facilitating better decision-making in high-stakes control environments. My work extends to adaptive thresholding methods and hybrid fusion architectures that merge cyber and physical signatures for improved reliability in critical energy and industrial systems.</p>
